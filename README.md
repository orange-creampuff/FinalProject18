# Description of Game

Backstory:
You have set off a can of tear gas on a mob, angering them severely. They have chased you into a forest. When it becomes dark, they decide not to enter the forest, but to wait upon the entrance to wait for you to return. After all, they think, there is no other exit to the forest. But there is.

- This is a text-based maze with a 3 by 3 grid arranged as below:
  * 1  2  3
  * 4  5  6
  * 7  8  9.

- The entrance is at square 1 and the exit is at square 8. 

- Generally, players can move to any adjacent square (up, down, left, right, but not diagonally). 
  * However, there are usually obstructions that prevent you from doing so. 
  * Conversely, you may encounter situations where you can move further than 1 square.
